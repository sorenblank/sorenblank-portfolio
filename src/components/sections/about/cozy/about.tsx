              Lately I am more drowned into Web Development since thatâ€™s my main
              field of work and exploration these days. I am mostly doing React,
              Next.js, Solid.js, Tailwind etc lately.

              Computers, smartphones, cars, and all kinds of technological
              advancements have always fascinated me. I got my first computer
              back in 2011, and like every kid, I enjoyed playing games like GTA
              Vice City, NFS MW 2005 (GOAT), and House of the Dead. I dreamed of
              making my own games, but as a kid, I lacked internet access and
              know-how, and school kept me busy ( typical asian ).

              This was true until COVID-19 hit. Just before the lockdown, I got
              a new desktop. With a PC, WiFi, and plenty of free time during
              lockdown, I finally had the chance to explore.

              I got busy again when school reopened later in 2021, with all the
              academic work. After my senior high school ended in July 2023, I
              decided to learn web development. Fast forward 1 year, I am
              currently working as a remote fulltime frontend/fullstack
              engineer.
