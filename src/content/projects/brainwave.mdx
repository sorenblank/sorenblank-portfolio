This is my first ever TailwindCSS project that I made watching along @adrianhajdin's YouTube tutorial. I learned a lot about the power of TailwindCSS and how it can be used to create beautiful and responsive websites in a short amount of time. I also learned about the Next.js framework and how it can be used to build fast and scalable web applications. The project allowed me to apply my front-end development skills and learn more about AI design principles. I used TailwindCSS to style the website, focusing on creating a clean and user-friendly interface. The project helped me understand the importance of user experience and visual design in AI websites. I also learned about responsive web design and cross-browser compatibility while working on this project.
