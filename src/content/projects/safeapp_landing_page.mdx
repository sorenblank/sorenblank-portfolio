This is a landing page for Safe App, a company that provides dispute resolution services for online and physical transactions. The project was built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. The landing page features a clean and modern design, with animations and transitions to enhance the user experience. The project allowed me to apply my front-end development skills and learn more about design principles. I used Next.js to build the landing page, focusing on creating a fast and scalable web application. The project helped me understand the importance of user experience and visual design in web applications. I also learned about responsive web design and cross-browser compatibility like Chrome, Mozilla, Safari while working on this project.
