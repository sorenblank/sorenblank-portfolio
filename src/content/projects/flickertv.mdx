This is my first ever open source project that I've made for programming community called HexCode. Anyone can contribute to this project by adding their favorite quote to the list. This project was to help people to learn how to contribute to open source projects and work with other developers. I am happy with the outcome of this project and I am looking forward to make more open source projects in the future.
