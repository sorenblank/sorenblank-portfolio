This was my first ever paid project. One of my friends wanted to start an online fashion store and asked me to design a landing page for his brand. I created a professional modern e-commerce landing page for a fashion brand called Wearvista. The project allowed me to apply my front-end development skills and learn more about e-commerce design principles. I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website, focusing on creating a clean and user-friendly interface. The project helped me understand the importance of user experience and visual design in e-commerce websites. I also learned about responsive web design and cross-browser compatibility while working on this project. Overall, it was a great learning experience that helped me kickstart my career as a web developer.
