This is one of my earliest NextJS projects. I built this project to learn more about the NextJS framework and how it can be used to build fast and scalable web applications. I also wanted to learn more about the TailwindCSS framework and how it can be used to create beautiful and responsive websites in a short amount of time. This was a great learning experience. Loved making this one. I also later one made this one using Material Ui.
